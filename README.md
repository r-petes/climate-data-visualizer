# Pollutant visualizer
Fall '21 OSU Hackathon project, pollutant data visualization web app

## Inspiration

Data visualization is important for being able to understand the scope of a problem, particularly in regards to climate change and other large, almost unimagineable issues. 

## What it does

Our Pollutant Data Visualizer allows a user to select a state and a county to get information on the amount of different pollutants in the air.

## How we built it

We built this webpage by using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS (with Bootstrap) to lay out our project and give it the functionality we needed. Since we needed data
on the air quality of different locations, we decided to use an EPA API that already has that information and we would pull this data
based on the user selection of the state, county, and the date they wished to look at.

We used the library Chart.js to make the graphs to show the pollutants based on user selection.
